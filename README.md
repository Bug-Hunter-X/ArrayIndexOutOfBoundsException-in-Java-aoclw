# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This exception is thrown when code tries to access an array element using an index that is outside the bounds of the array.

The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code that throws the exception. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array indices to avoid this type of error.  Always ensure the index is within the valid range (0 to array.length -1).
